% with boundary conditions U(0, t) = Ux(2pi, t) = 0, and initial condition 
% U(x, 0) = 0, but U(x, 0) = 10 for x around the center.
% Uses a centered-in-space finite difference method.
% Uses RK4 method, for the integration in time. Uses 300 spatial steps.
% the inputs are a is as in the equation above.
% steps is the number of iteration steps used to integrate from t=0..10.
% 
% The interesting part here is that the laplacian Dxx does not change
% during the computation and it is sparse all the way.
% The approximation of the U(x,t) is sparse initially, but during the
% computation gets more and more dense, as the rows get filled during 
% the integration.

% takes N, the length of the vector, returns a (N-1)x(N-1) matrix Dxx,
% with U0 being ommitted because it is 0.
% note that 
%     Uxxi = (Ui-1 - 2*Ui + Ui+1)/h^2 for i=2..N-1
% and
%     Uxx2 = (U1 - 2U2 + U3)/h^2, U1 = 0
%  => Uxx2 = (-2U2 + U3)/h^2
% also,
%     Uxx(N) = (U(N-1) - 2U(N) + U(N+1))/h^2, 
%     Ux(N) = (U(N+1)-U(N-1))/2h = 0 => U(N+1) = U(N-1)
%  => Uxx(N) = (2U(N-1) - 2U(N)/h^2
% The matrix will not be divided by h^2, since it is unknown
