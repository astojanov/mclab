* McLab
** goal of project
** basic structure
* Extensible design
** intro
   provide different abstractions and paradigms to scientific
   programmers
   - new data structure capabilities
   - new control flow 
   - different language constructs
** Tools
*** Metalexer
    boxy picture with colours explaining how it merges new stuff
*** JastAdd Parser
*** JastAdd
*** Analysis system
    Just a brief mention saying we think this is important have
* Aspect Matlab
  glue that sticks the general discussion of the frontend to the
  specific case 
  This is a specific extension
  Maybe talk about the possibility of having other extensions of the
  main project and 
* Anton applications
* Domain specific challenges
** describe matlab issues
*** Matlab very dynamic
*** confusing syntax and semantics
**** change depending on environment
     fn vs script
*** weaving 
    - if you can't tell if a name use is a variable access or a
      function call then how do you weave gets
    - simple runtime checks could work, but naive ones change
      semantics of the code and introduce unwanted use of unwanted
      features
*** need analysis
**** how it fits into the projects
**** what it does
* Anton examples
